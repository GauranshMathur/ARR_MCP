# ARR-MCP Improvements

## Major Improvements

1. **Structured Logging System**
   - Added a dedicated logger package with multiple log levels
   - Configurable log levels via command-line flags
   - Thread-safe logging with proper timestamp formatting

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Improved error messages with better context
   - Consistent error format throughout the application
   - Error details in API responses for easier debugging

3. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - Added signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
   - Graceful shutdown with timeout
   - Proper resource cleanup on exit

4. **Service Health Checks**
   - Added `/v1/service-health` endpoint for checking ARR service connectivity
   - Service health checker interface for each ARR client
   - Aggregated health status reporting

5. **Request Validation**
   - Added parameter validation against tool schemas
   - Required parameter checking
   - Type validation for input parameters

6. **Configuration Validation**
   - Added configuration validation on startup
   - Better error messages for misconfiguration
   - Sensible defaults for all configuration options

7. **Improved HTTP Client**
   - Context-aware HTTP requests
   - Better error reporting for HTTP failures
   - Timeout controls for all requests
   - Proper URL encoding for all parameters

8. **Streaming Support**
   - Added infrastructure for streaming responses
   - Support for partial responses via the MCP protocol
   - Chunked encoding support

9. **Unit Testing**
   - Added unit tests for server functionality
   - Mock implementations for testing
   - Test coverage for core components

10. **Documentation**
    - Added testing documentation
    - Improved code comments throughout the codebase
    - Better parameter descriptions in tool definitions

## Technical Improvements

1. **URL Encoding**
   - Fixed manual query string building with proper URL encoding
   - Improved parameter handling for Prowlarr categories

2. **HTTP Method Constants**
   - Replaced string literals with http.Method constants

3. **Code Organization**
   - More consistent function signatures
   - Better interface abstractions
   - Clearer separation of concerns

4. **Context Support**
   - Added context-aware methods for all client operations
   - Timeout controls for long-running operations
   - Cancellation support

5. **Improved Server Initialization**
   - Better server initialization flow
   - Proper HTTP server configuration
   - Custom router setup

## Results

The codebase is now more robust, easier to maintain, and ready for production use. The improvements address all the key areas identified in the assessment, particularly:

- Missing core functionality is now implemented
- MCP protocol implementation is more complete
- The gap between documentation and implementation is closed
- Production readiness is significantly improved
- Testing and validation are now present
